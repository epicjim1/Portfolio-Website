                    This is where some of my major and most impactful projects are displayed!
                    Most of my projects focus primarily on Game Development including
                    frameworks and tools such as Unity, Visual Studio Code, Blender and so much more!
                    My projects also showcase the Model-View-Controller framework, Google Ads,
                    In-App Purchasing, and most importantly, fun user interaction! I also often
                    dabble with firmware and embedded systems.

                    <p>
                        This is a mobile version of the BallDrop game I made during the panademic to learn how to program.
                        It is a 2D physics based game where the player must get their ball into a black hole by moving various
                        platforms and avoiding obstacles, similar to cut the rope. I used the Unity game engine with C# to create
                        the foundation and used later used Googles Ads API, Swfit, and XCode to integrate it over to the IOS framework.
                        All models, effects, and sounds were handcrafted create the most immersive experience I could give.
                        This game has been played by 600+ users and was on the top 50 Puzzle games list on the AppStore.

                    <p>
                        I love to learn new languages and applications so I built this entire website from
                        scratch with Visual Studio Code using HTML, Css, and JavaScript. This website uses
                        advanced layout techniques and is fully dynamic and scalable. While making this I
                        learned the impotance and subtleties of design, transitioning animations with Css
                        keyframing, incorporating images seemlessly into the flow of the layout, and setting
                        up usable forms without error.

                    <p>
                        A childhood favourite! I recreated the classic Tic-Tac-Toe Game using the Java Swing GUI and
                        through implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern. In addition, I added my
                        own twists on the game by implementing a difficulty feature that impacts AI intellegence,
                        a round feature that sees a player play a certain number of rounds before a game is over,
                        and a dynamic file saving and viewing system to see past game results. This game was played
                        by 50+ high school students and was used in Computer Science classroom demonstrations. Click

                        Over the past 3 years, I have built multiple circuits and embedded systems, which have
                        allowed me to further explore the field of computers and how their systems work. Here
                        are my most notable projects:

                    <h2>05<br>Path of Revenge Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the first game I made during the first summer of quarintine. It was a harsh experience
                        trying to learn the Unity application alongside learning how to program. I made this game to
                        experience a little bit of my future goal, to tell moving stories through creating new technologies. 
                        In the end I succeded in creating a fully functional game with enemy AI with different states,
                        optimization on the GPU throughout the game, and realistic physics in a game environemt.

                    <p>
                        This project was about learning to implement machine learning on 3D objects. This project is more of a
                        bunch of similar protypes, one of which was a cube learning how to get from point A to point B avoiding
                        obstacles such as walls enemy cubes, and projectiles. I used the Unity game engine with C# and used
                        Unity's ML Agents framwork for the machine learning agents.
                        This project is unreleased and is still being worked on.
